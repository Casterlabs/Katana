### Casterlabs (Us!)

We've built Katana to handle our http infrastrucure and to expose our API services to the web. With Katana, we serve 1.6M requests/month totalling 240GB.

### Other People

"I've been using Katana as a reverse proxy for my homelab. It works great out-of-the-box for things like Proxmox that normally require a lot of configuring to get working correctly." - [Max Kulik](https://klabsdev.com)
